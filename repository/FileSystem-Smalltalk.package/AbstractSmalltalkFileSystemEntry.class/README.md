I am abstract entry for the in-image Smalltalk FileSystem. I am used for entities that have no real representation in the image.

By default the Smalltalk FileSystem adds extension methods to existing structures in the image, such as packages, classes or methods. However certain entities represented as separate files in the Smalltalk FileSystem have no corresponding single structure in the image. However the FileSystem needs a special objects to retrieve information about these entities.
